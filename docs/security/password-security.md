# Password Security Implementation

## Overview

This project now implements **secure password hashing** using bcrypt, a battle-tested cryptographic algorithm specifically designed for password storage. Passwords are **never** stored in plain text.

## What Changed

### Before ❌

```typescript
// INSECURE: Plain text password storage
await User.create({
  username,
  email,
  passwordHash: password, // Not actually hashed!
});

// INSECURE: Direct string comparison
if (user.passwordHash !== password) {
  return res.status(401);
}
```

### After ✅

```typescript
// SECURE: Hashed password using bcrypt
const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS);
await User.create({
  username,
  email,
  passwordHash, // Actually hashed with bcrypt
});

// SECURE: Constant-time comparison using bcrypt
const isPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.passwordHash);
if (!isPasswordValid) {
  return res.status(401);
}
```

## Why Bcrypt?

### 1. **Computational Cost (Slow by Design)**

- Bcrypt is intentionally slow to compute
- Takes ~100-300ms to hash a password
- Makes brute-force attacks impractical
- Adjustable cost factor (salt rounds)

### 2. **Built-in Salt**

- Automatically generates unique random salt for each password
- Stored in the hash output
- Prevents rainbow table attacks
- No need to manage salts separately

### 3. **Future-Proof**

- Cost factor can be increased as computers get faster
- Algorithm has withstood decades of cryptographic analysis
- Industry standard for password hashing

### 4. **Timing Attack Protection**

- `bcrypt.compare()` uses constant-time comparison
- Prevents attackers from learning information from response times
- More secure than manual string comparison

## Implementation Details

### Salt Rounds

```typescript
const SALT_ROUNDS = 10;
```

**What are salt rounds?**

- Number of iterations the bcrypt algorithm performs
- Higher = more secure but slower
- Each increment doubles the computation time

**Current setting: 10 rounds**

- Takes ~100-300ms on modern hardware
- 2^10 = 1,024 iterations
- Good balance between security and performance
- Recommended by security experts

### Registration Flow

1. User submits username, email, and password
2. Server checks if user already exists
3. **Password is hashed:** `bcrypt.hash(password, 10)`
4. User record created with hashed password
5. Original password is never stored

```typescript
const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS);
await User.create({
  username,
  email,
  passwordHash, // Stored: $2b$10$abc123...
});
```

### Login Flow

1. User submits email and password
2. Server finds user by email
3. **Password is verified:** `bcrypt.compare(password, user.passwordHash)`
4. If valid, JWT token is generated
5. Original password is discarded

```typescript
const isPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.passwordHash);
if (!isPasswordValid) {
  return res.status(401).json({
    message: 'Authentication failed. Password is incorrect.',
  });
}
```

## Hash Format

Bcrypt hashes look like this:

```
$2b$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy
│  │  │                    │
│  │  │                    └─ Salt + Hash (53 characters)
│  │  └──────────────────────── Salt rounds (10)
│  └─────────────────────────── Bcrypt version (2b)
└────────────────────────────── Identifier ($2b$ = bcrypt)
```

**Components:**

- **Version identifier** (`$2b$`): Indicates bcrypt algorithm version
- **Cost factor** (`10`): Number of salt rounds
- **Salt**: 22-character random salt (embedded in hash)
- **Hash**: 31-character password hash

## Security Benefits

### 1. **Prevents Plain Text Exposure**

- Even if database is leaked, passwords are safe
- Hashes cannot be reversed to original passwords
- Attackers must try to crack each hash individually

### 2. **Prevents Rainbow Table Attacks**

- Each password has unique salt
- Pre-computed hash tables are useless
- Attacker must crack each hash from scratch

### 3. **Slows Brute Force Attacks**

```
Without bcrypt: 10 billion attempts/second
With bcrypt (10 rounds): ~10 attempts/second
Result: 1 billion times slower!
```

### 4. **Protects Against Timing Attacks**

- `bcrypt.compare()` always takes same amount of time
- Attackers can't learn information from timing
- Prevents character-by-character password guessing

## Testing

All tests have been updated to use proper password hashing:

```typescript
// Before test, create user with hashed password
const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash('password123', 10);
await User.create({
  username: 'testuser',
  email: 'test@example.com',
  passwordHash,
});

// Test login with plain text password (hash is done internally)
const response = await request(app).post('/auth/login').send({
  email: 'test@example.com',
  password: 'password123', // Plain text in request
});
```

## Performance Considerations

### Registration Performance

- **Hashing time:** ~100-300ms per registration
- **Acceptable:** Registration is infrequent operation
- **User experience:** Barely noticeable delay

### Login Performance

- **Comparison time:** ~100-300ms per login
- **Acceptable:** Login is infrequent operation
- **User experience:** Minimal impact

### Scaling Considerations

- For high-traffic apps, consider:
  - Caching authenticated sessions
  - Rate limiting login attempts
  - Using faster hardware for bcrypt
  - Adjusting salt rounds based on threat model

## Best Practices

✅ **DO:**

- Use bcrypt or argon2 for password hashing
- Use at least 10 salt rounds
- Hash passwords on registration
- Use bcrypt.compare() for verification
- Log authentication failures (for monitoring)
- Implement rate limiting on login endpoints

❌ **DON'T:**

- Store passwords in plain text
- Use weak hashing (MD5, SHA1, SHA256 without salt)
- Implement your own password hashing
- Use the same salt for all passwords
- Log passwords (even for debugging)
- Send passwords over HTTP (always use HTTPS)

## Future Improvements

### 1. **Argon2 (Alternative)**

```typescript
import argon2 from 'argon2';

// Hashing
const hash = await argon2.hash(password);

// Verification
const isValid = await argon2.verify(hash, password);
```

- Newer algorithm (2015 winner of Password Hashing Competition)
- More resistant to GPU/ASIC attacks
- Configurable memory usage

### 2. **Password Strength Requirements**

```typescript
// Add validation
if (password.length < 12) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    message: 'Password must be at least 12 characters',
  });
}
```

### 3. **Password Reset Flow**

- Generate secure reset tokens
- Expire tokens after use/timeout
- Invalidate existing sessions on password change

### 4. **Multi-Factor Authentication**

- Add TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- SMS or email verification
- Hardware security keys
